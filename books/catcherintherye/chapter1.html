      If your really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're <em>nice</em> and all―I'm not saying that―but they're also touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my <em>brother</em> and all. He's in Hollywood. That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He's got a lot of dough, now. He didn't <em>use</em> to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of short stories, <em>The Secret Goldfish</em>, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was "The Secret Goldfish." It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even mention them to me.

      Where
I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this
school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You've
probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines,
always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all
you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a
horse anywhere <em>near</em> the place. And underneath the guy on the horse's
picture, it always says: "Since 1888 we have been molding boys into
splendid, clear-thinking young men." Strictly for the birds. They don't do
any damn more <em>mold</em>ing at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I
didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe
two guys. If that many. And they probably <em>came</em> to Pencey that way.
    </p>

    <p class="mb2">
      Anyway,
it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon
Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of
the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey
didn't win. I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way
the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in
the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and
you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn't
see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and
terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was
there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team
hardly ever brought many people with them.
    </p>

    <p class="mb2">
      There
were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were allowed
to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at
it. I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once
in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses
or even just giggling or something. Old Selma Thurmer―she was the
headmaster's daughter―showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't
exactly the type that drove you mad with desire. She was a pretty nice girl,
though. I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck
up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big nose and her nails were all
bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all
over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. What I liked about her, she
didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was.
She probably knew what a phony slob he was.

    <p class="mb2">
      The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was
because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam
manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We'd gone in to New York that
morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn't have the
meet. I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It
wasn't all my fault. I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know
where to get off. So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around
dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train. It
was pretty funny, in a way.
    </p>

    <p class="mb2">
      The
other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say
good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He had the grippe, and I figured I
probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me
this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn't
coming back to Pencey.
    </p>

    <p class="mb2">
      I
forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn't supposed to come
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and
not applying myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying
myself―especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a
conference with old Thurmer―but I didn't do it. So I got the ax. They
give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a very good academic
rating, Pencey. It really does.
    </p>

    <p class="mb2">
      Anyway,
it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top
of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. The
week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room,
with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of
crooks. Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full
of crooks anyway. The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it
has―I'm not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking
down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn't watching the game too
much. What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a
good-by. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving
them. I hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but
when I leave a place I like to <em>know</em> I'm leaving it. If you don't, you
feel even worse.
